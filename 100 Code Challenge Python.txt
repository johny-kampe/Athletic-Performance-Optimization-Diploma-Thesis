8. Exercise 1, we can't have the same quotes in a print, print("print('what to print')"). " and ' are identical to the compiler
but you can't have the same multiple times in a string.
9. \n = seperator, string1 + string2 = concatenation
10. Solving Exercise 2
11. input() function, it returns string values
12. Exercise 3, len(x) = counts the number of characters in a string

14. Exercise 4
15. Variable Naming
16. Day 1 Project: Band Name Generator
17. Congratulations!
18. I'm going to make a program that can calculate things
19. Primitive data types = string, integer, boolean, float. print("Hello"[0]) -> prints the first character of the string
20. Type Error, Type Checking, Type Conversion. print(type(num_char)) -> tells us the type of the variable, new_num_char = str(num_char),
float(123), float("100.70"), str(700+str(100)
